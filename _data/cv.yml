      institution: Department of Computer Science, Hunter College, the City University of New York
      year: Jun 2022 - Present
      description:
        - Utilized BLAST to analyze protein sequence similarities for large dataset (used in PortalCG), providing valuable
insights into out-of-distribution generalization of PortalCG in predicting chemical protein interactions.
        - Successfully implemented a deep learning-based residue-residue contact classification with a BERT-based protein
          large language model (LLM) DISAE and achieved an accuracy of 98.81%.
        - Implemented a comprehensive pipeline leveraging diverse deep learning algorithms, including Transformers,
          Bi-directional LSTMs, Attention Mechanisms, and Deep CNNs, to predict protein binding affinity. Integrated
          LLMs - BERT-based DISAE and ESM-2 models into a deep learning architecture for protein binding affinity prediction.
        - Modeled Mutli-Task learning-based deep regression algorithms for prediction of chemical protein binding affinity and
          achieved mean absolute error of 0.43, Pearson correlation of 0.86, and Spearman correlation of 0.88.
