## Project Description

In this project, I embarked on a fascinating exploration of QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) predictive modeling and its general workflow. To gain practical insights into this field, I focused on the challenging problem of binary classification for cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibition.

Cytochrome P450 3A4 is a crucial enzyme involved in drug metabolism, and its inhibition can have significant implications for drug safety and efficacy. Through this project, I aimed to delve into the intricacies of predicting whether a molecule would inhibit this enzyme or not, using QSAR techniques.

By employing a range of cheminformatics tools and methodologies, I established a robust binary classification model for cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibition. The project not only provided valuable insights into the molecular features associated with inhibition but also demonstrated the application of QSAR modeling in drug discovery and development.

For a deeper understanding of the classification process and the technical aspects involved, I invite you to explore my dedicated blog post titled [Binary Classification](https://amiteshbadkul.github.io/blog/2022/cheminformatics/). It dives into the nitty-gritty of the classification methodology, feature selection, model evaluation, and the implications of the results obtained.

To explore the implementation details, access the code, and access additional resources related to this project, visit my GitHub repository [CYP3A4](https://github.com/AmiteshBadkul/CYP3A4). You can examine the code, reproduce the classification workflow, or even extend the project for your own research endeavors.

Join me in unraveling the intricacies of QSAR predictive modeling and its application in cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibition classification. Together, let's explore the fascinating world of cheminformatics and its potential in drug discovery.
