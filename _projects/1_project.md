## Description
To understand the process of creating and running a molecular dynamic simulation using [NAMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/) and [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/), I ran a simple simulation of a water box. I was able to successfully validate the nature of water. To read more about the simulation check [out](https://amiteshbadkul.github.io/blog/2022/md-simulation/).
