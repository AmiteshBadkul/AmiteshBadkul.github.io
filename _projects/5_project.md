I have always been fascinated with my surroundings wherever I am, I always end up finding scenic, aesthetic beauty in daily life surroundings. And consequently I try to capture the same using a camera (be it phone, DSLRs, film cameras). However, not always the photograph is developed the way we perceive it.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
    <img src="https://imgur.com/DXC8huw.jpg" alt="Snow" style="width:50%">

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html src="" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/photography/film3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/photography/film2.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

<div class="caption">
    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/photography/film4.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
