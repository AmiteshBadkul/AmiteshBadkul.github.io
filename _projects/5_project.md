I have always been fascinated with my surroundings wherever I am, I always end up finding scenic, aesthetic beauty in daily life surroundings. And consequently I try to capture the same using a camera (be it phone, DSLRs, film cameras). However, not always the photograph is developed the way we perceive it.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
