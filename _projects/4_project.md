## Project Description

In response to the urgent need to contain the spread of COVID-19, I took on the challenge of developing specialized tools to assist radiologists in identifying COVID-19 Chest X-Ray scans. By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and computer vision, this project aimed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis from X-ray images.

The developed tools employ advanced algorithms and techniques to analyze and interpret chest X-ray scans. By automatically detecting and highlighting potential COVID-19 indicators, these tools aid radiologists in making informed decisions and expediting the diagnosis process.

To gain deeper insights into the development process and understand the intricacies of COVID-19 detection using X-ray imaging, I invite you to explore my detailed blog post titled [COVID-19 Detector](https://amiteshbadkul.github.io/blog/2022/cxr/). This post provides a comprehensive overview of the methodology employed, the underlying techniques, and the significance of this work in the fight against the pandemic.

To access the code, resources, and additional details related to this project, visit my GitHub repository [cxr-bit-plane](https://github.com/AmiteshBadkul/cxr-bit-plane). Here, you can explore the implementation details, replicate the experiments, and further extend the tools for your own research or practical applications.
