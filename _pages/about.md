Hi! I have recently graduated from [BITS Pilani, Hyderabad](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/), majoring in Electrical and Electronics Engineering & Chemistry. Currently, I have the privilege of conducting research under the guidance of [Dr. Lei Xie](http://compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~leixie/).


My academic journey has sparked a strong interest in cutting-edge fields of **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and their applications in Biology and Chemistry**. Additionally, I’m intrigued by **Molecular Dynamics Simulations**.


Beyond my research pursuits, I find immense joy in reading about and exploring applications of Computational Sciences. I’m also passionate about Photography, and you’ll often find me capturing captivating moments. When it comes to sports, I am an enthusiastic player of Squash, Basketball, and Volleyball. Moreover, I’m an avid follower of Formula 1, always eager to stay up to date with the latest races and developments in the sport.

I strongly value the role of documentation in research as it plays a crucial part in comprehending the subject matter more effectively, facilitating the systematic integration of thoughts, and identifying any potential flaws in the study. With the dedicated blog post section on this website, my primary objectives are to share my unique thought process to aid others in understanding various topics, receive constructive criticism to refine my work, enhance my own understanding of the subject matter, and actively contribute to the expansion of knowledge by introducing novel insights and augmenting existing knowledge.

Feel free to explore my projects by visiting the [Projects](https://amiteshbadkul.github.io/projects/) page and my [CV](https://amiteshbadkul.github.io/cv/).
