Hi! I'm a final year undergraduate student currently pursuing Electrical and Electronics Engineering & Chemistry at [BITS Pilani, Hyderabad](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/). Currently working under the supervision of [Dr. Lei Xie](http://compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~leixie/) and [Dr. Ashif Iquebal](https://sites.google.com/view/ashif-iquebal/) on various [projects](https://amiteshbadkul.github.io/projects/).

My research interests include **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Applications of ML & DL in Healthcare & Natural Sciences, and Molecular Dynamics Simulation**.

Apart from this I am passionate about Computational Sciences, Photography, Squash, Basketball, Volleyball and I actively follow Formula1. <br />

I believe that documentation is a significant component of research. It helps to understand the subject matter better by systematically integrating one's thought and uncovering flaws involved in the study.

Through the blog post section of the website, I aim to:
1. Share my thought process to help others understand topics
2. Obtain constructive criticism on my work
3. Improve my understanding of the subject matter
4. Contribute to adding new knowledge and enhancing existing knowledge

I believe that documentation is a significant component of research and helps in systematically integrating one's thought process to understand the subject matter better. It assists in uncovering flaws involved in the study. Through the blog post section of the website, I aim to share my thought process to help others understand topics, obtain constructive criticism on my work, improve my understanding of the subject matter and hopefully contribute to adding new knowledge and enhancing existing knowledge.
